# Prolucid-Assignment
An assignment for a job application where I am supposed to arrange the sentences within the short story in the txt file in alphabetical order. 

Simply run the Python script from the project root directory:
python3 ArrangeSentences.py

Once completed, you will find SortedStory.txt in the same folder.
